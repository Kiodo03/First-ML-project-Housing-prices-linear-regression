# First-ML-project-Housing-prices-linear-regression
End-to-end implementation of a Linear Regression model on the California Housing dataset using Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn). Features EDA and model evaluation
This repository contains a practical implementation of Linear Regression applied to the California Housing dataset.

Coming from a theoretical background in Mathematical Engineering, I developed this project to translate statistical concepts into efficient Python code. The workflow includes Data Cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Feature Selection, and Model Evaluation using standard metrics (MSE, R²)
